Next, in order to use the pa2-runner command, you must first run these commands from
either ieng6 or the pi-cluster.

```
$ echo "alias pa2-runner='/home/linux/ieng6/cs30f/public/pa2-runner'" >> ~/.bash_profile
$ echo "alias pa2-debug='/home/linux/ieng6/cs30f/public/pa2-debug'" >> ~/.bash_profile

$ source ~/.bash_profile
```
